# Firefly-Calculator

This calculator had its initial code taken from a previous calculator project I worked on during my College years, after which I modified it to fit the specifications of the coding challenge.

As the initial calculator was in Python, I ran into a couple of obstacles, such as having to manually alter the buttons to be rounded instead of square, whereas a Javascript calculator could have rounded buttons by default.

Additionally, this interfered significantly with adding in the required features. While I was able to start work on creating a log of past equations (via self.history in the calc.py), I was unable to complete it in the allotted timeframe. If I had more time, I would likely dedicate it to adding in these features within the Hamburger Menu, or rewriting the calculator entirely to start with a Javascript format that would be easier to work with.

Currently, the calculator is limited to 12 digits, with any attempt to add more than that, which would cause the entered number to be longer than the width of the screen, not being input. Results of equations can still reach over 12 digits, another factor that I would like to work on amending.
